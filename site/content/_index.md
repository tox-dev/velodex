- **Read-through cache** Proxies [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/), [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or any upstream
  index or registry. A cache miss streams upstream bytes to the client while writing them aside, so the first pull pays
  no penalty; every later one comes from disk. Each artifact (a wheel or an image layer) verifies against its sha256 and
  is stored once, content-addressed, however many projects pull it.
- **Private packages that shadow upstream** Publish over each ecosystem's own upload API into virtual indexes, where
  your `utils` beats the `utils` someone registered upstream and your image beats the one on the public registry. One
  URL, no second index to configure, no [dependency confusion](@/core/indexes.md).
- **One model, every ecosystem** The same cache/host/merge roles sit behind every packaging format peryx speaks, each
  one a driver that owns its wire protocol and artifact rules. Adding a format is a driver, not a rewrite. See
  [ecosystems](@/ecosystems/_index.md) for what each speaks today.
- **Honest freshness** Upstream `Cache-Control` decides how long a page serves from cache; a background sweep catches
  upstream changes even for things nobody is requesting; outages degrade to stale-but-working. Concurrent misses for one
  page, wheel, or layer share a single upstream fetch.
- **Built to operate** One [TOML](https://toml.io/) file, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics, per-file usage
  drill-down, structured logs, a live web UI, and a data directory you can back up with `cp`. Optional TLS or automatic
  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates. No JVM, no database server, idle RAM in the tens of MB.
- **Proven with real clients** The test suite drives each ecosystem's real clients against a live peryx, holds 100% line
  and function coverage, passes the [OCI distribution-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)
  conformance suite, and the [performance numbers](@/core/performance.md) come with the exact commands that produced
  them.
