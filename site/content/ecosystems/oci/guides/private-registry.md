A cached OCI index reads through to an upstream registry. When that upstream is private, velodex needs credentials to
run its bearer-token handshake; give them on the index and clients pull locally, presenting only velodex's own auth (or
none). This isolates the upstream secret in one process instead of on every developer's machine.

## The index

A cached OCI proxy is an `[[index]]` with `ecosystem = "oci"`, a `route`, and `cached` pointing at the upstream's
registry root. Add the credential fields the upstream expects:

```toml
# velodex.toml
[[index]]
name = "ghcr"
route = "ghcr"
ecosystem = "oci"
cached = "https://ghcr.io"
username = "<user>"
token = "<pat>"
```

velodex supports three credential fields on a cached index:

- `username` and `password`: Basic-auth credentials velodex presents when the upstream's `WWW-Authenticate` challenge
  asks for them.
- `token`: a bearer token, used directly. It takes precedence over `username`/`password` when both are set.

Which you set depends on the upstream:

- **GHCR**: `username = "<github-user>"`, `token = "<personal-access-token>"` (a PAT with `read:packages`).
- **Amazon ECR**: `cached = "https://<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com"`, with `username = "AWS"` and the
  password from `aws ecr get-login-password`. ECR tokens are short-lived; rotate the value on the schedule the token's
  lifetime demands.
- **Artifactory or Harbor**: point `cached` at the registry's `/v2/` root and set `username`/`password`, or `token` if
  the server issues bearer tokens.

## Keep secrets out of the file

The credential fields hold literal strings, so a token in `velodex.toml` is a secret at rest. Restrict the file
(`chmod 600 velodex.toml`) and keep it out of version control. To avoid a plaintext token on disk, render the config
from a template at deploy time, injecting the value from a `VELODEX`-scoped environment variable or a secret manager.
See [configuration](@/core/configuration.md) for the precedence tiers and how the file is loaded.

## Pull

Assume velodex runs at `127.0.0.1:4433`. Docker and Podman trust a loopback registry over plain HTTP with no setup, so
on the same host a pull just works; `crane` and `podman` reaching it take an insecure flag. Over the network, serve
[TLS](@/core/serve-https.md) so clients need no flag at all.

Pull through velodex's route prefix; the upstream repository name follows it:

{% tabs(names="docker, podman, crane") %}

```shell
docker pull 127.0.0.1:4433/ghcr/<owner>/<image>:latest
```

%%%

```shell
podman pull --tls-verify=false 127.0.0.1:4433/ghcr/<owner>/<image>:latest
```

%%%

```shell
crane pull --insecure 127.0.0.1:4433/ghcr/<owner>/<image>:latest image.tar
```

{% end %}

velodex authenticates to the private upstream with the index's credentials, verifies each manifest and blob digest,
stores them, and serves them back. Clients never see the upstream secret; later pulls come from disk. Concurrent pulls
of one uncached layer share a single upstream fetch.

## Client-facing auth

The upstream credentials are separate from what clients present to velodex. A cached index does not require clients to
authenticate; anyone who can reach the route can pull through it. Restrict who reaches velodex at the network layer, or
front the cache with a [virtual index](@/core/indexes.md) when you need to combine it with a hosted store.
