A virtual index lists other indexes as `layers` and serves them under one route. Resolution is first-match per filename:
velodex walks the layers in order and keeps the first occurrence of each file, so a file in an earlier layer shadows the
same filename in a later one. Versions union across layers.

## A private layer over each cached index

```toml
[[index]]
name = "pypi"
cached = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

[[index]]
name = "corp"
cached = "https://myco.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi/simple/"
token = "<access-token>"

[[index]]
name = "team-hosted"
upload_token = "<secret>"

[[index]]
name = "team"
route = "team/dev"
layers = ["team-hosted", "corp"]
upload = "team-hosted"

[[index]]
name = "oss"
layers = ["team-hosted", "pypi"]
```

Clients using `/team/dev/simple/` see the team's uploads in front of the corporate cached index; clients using
`/oss/simple/` see the same uploads in front of pypi.org. One hosted store can back any number of virtual indexes.

Choose routes as stable URL prefixes. Segments may contain ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `.`, `_`, and `~`; separate
nested routes with `/`. Velodex validates routes once at startup so request routing can stay a fast prefix lookup, and
it rejects routes that collide with built-in endpoints such as `browse`, `stats`, `+stats`, and `+status`.

## Chaining

A layer can itself be a virtual index, so inheritance chains work:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "staging"
layers = ["staging-hosted", "team"]
upload = "staging-hosted"
```

`staging` resolves through `staging-hosted`, then `team-hosted`, then `corp`.

## Where uploads land

`upload` names the hosted layer that receives POSTs to the virtual index's route. Omit it and velodex picks the virtual
index's first hosted layer; a virtual index of only cached indexes rejects uploads with `405`.

## Failure behavior

A layer that cannot answer (a down upstream with a cold cache) is skipped with a warning rather than failing the whole
page, so your own packages stay installable during an upstream outage. A cached index with a warm cache serves its
cached copy instead.
