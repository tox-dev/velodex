peryx stands in front of PyPI as a drop-in, and the promise that carries is simple: an upload that succeeds against
[Warehouse](https://pypi.org/) (the software pypi.org runs) should succeed against peryx. Warehouse and pip do not
demand a canonical spelling of every field; they resolve a project and a release by normalized identity,
[PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) on the name and [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) on the
version, and take whatever spelling names the right thing. peryx does the same across four upload surfaces, each a place
it once was stricter than the index it fronts. This page explains what it accepts and why, and where accepting a broader
input still stops short of accepting the wrong one.

## Un-normalized wheels

peryx accepts a wheel whose internal `.dist-info` directory is not spelled the modern, normalized way, as long as it
names the same project and version as the filename. The check compares normalized identity rather than exact bytes,
which is what lets historical artifacts through.

### The rule changed under wheels

A wheel's layout is `{name}-{version}.dist-info/`, and the filename is `{name}-{version}-{tags}.whl`. For years the two
`{name}` fields were written however the build tool spelled the project: `Flask-0.12-py2.py3-none-any.whl` shipped a
`Flask-0.12.dist-info` directory, mixed case and all. Only later did the ecosystem settle on
[PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) normalization, which lowercases the name and folds every run of `-`, `_`,
and `.` to a single `-`, and current build backends write the directory that way. The wheels built before that
convention did not vanish; they are still on PyPI, and installers still install them.

pip and [Warehouse](https://pypi.org/) (pypi.org) never demanded a byte-exact directory. They compare the directory's
project name and version to the filename's after normalizing both, so `Flask-0.12.dist-info` satisfies a `flask-0.12`
filename. peryx now does the same: PEP 503 on the name, [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) parsing on the
version. The [reference](@/ecosystems/pypi/reference/uploads.md#wheel-dist-info-matching) states the exact comparison.

### The failure it prevents

peryx used to build the expected directory name from the filename and require the archive to contain that exact string.
An older wheel whose directory read `Flask-0.12.dist-info` was measured against the computed `flask-0.12.dist-info` and
rejected on upload with `.dist-info directory ... does not match expected ...`, even though the two name the same
release.

That made peryx stricter than the index it stands in front of, and the gap bit where peryx is meant to disappear:

- **Mirroring.** A cached index that pulls a historical wheel from pypi.org, or a migration that re-uploads an
  organization's back catalogue into a hosted index, carries whatever `.dist-info` spelling the original build wrote. A
  file pip installs from pypi.org could not be served through peryx.
- **Re-uploading.** A team moving a private index onto peryx, or restoring from a backup of older builds, hit the same
  wall for artifacts they had shipped for years.

Refusing a wheel that pypi.org accepts breaks the drop-in promise. The index in front of PyPI should take every file
PyPI would. Matching by normalized identity closes that gap while keeping the guarantee that matters. The metadata
inside the wheel belongs to the project and version on the label.

### What stays strict

Normalizing the comparison is not loosening it. A directory whose normalized name or parsed version genuinely differs
from the filename is still rejected, and so is an archive with no `.dist-info` directory or more than one. peryx accepts
a different *spelling* of the right identity; it does not accept the wrong identity. The point is parity with pip and
Warehouse, not leniency past them.

## MD5 on upload

peryx accepts an upload that declares only a legacy `md5_digest`, verifies it, and then never mentions MD5 again. An
index built around SHA-256 still takes an MD5-only upload, does not bother computing MD5 when a stronger digest is
already declared, and serves back a file that carries no MD5 at all.

### Why accept MD5 at all

[Warehouse](https://pypi.org/) accepts `md5_digest` on its upload API. Clients and CI have declared MD5 to PyPI for
years: some older tooling sends only `md5_digest`, and hand-rolled upload scripts often compute the one hash that ships
in the Python standard library without a thought about which. An index that rejects those uploads is stricter than the
one it emulates, and the gap shows up exactly where peryx is meant to disappear: a `twine upload` or a mirrored publish
that succeeds against pypi.org fails against peryx.

peryx used to reject an MD5-only upload outright, even with a correct digest, because it never computed MD5 and so had
nothing to check the declared value against. It now computes MD5 over the staged content when that is the only digest
the client declared, verifies it, and stores the file. A correct `md5_digest` is accepted; a wrong one is rejected with
`md5_digest mismatch`, the same way a wrong SHA-256 is. The behavior matches Warehouse, so an upload that works against
pypi.org works against peryx.

### Why skip MD5 when a stronger digest is present

peryx already hashes every upload with SHA-256, which is how it content-addresses the file, and with BLAKE2b-256, both
computed in one pass as it reads the stream. Verifying a declared `sha256_digest` or `blake2_256_digest` is then a
comparison against a hash it already holds.

Computing MD5 is different: peryx does not need MD5 for anything else, so producing it means reading the staged content
a second time. When the client declared a `sha256_digest` or `blake2_256_digest`, verifying that digest already proves
the bytes are the ones the client sent. A matching MD5 on top would add no assurance, and MD5 is the weaker hash of the
set, so re-reading the file to check it would be work spent to confirm something already confirmed. peryx verifies MD5
only when it is the sole digest on offer, which is the one case where skipping it would leave the upload unchecked.

### Why MD5 is not re-served

Accepting MD5 on upload does not make peryx an MD5 index. The simple-index entry for a stored file carries a `sha256`
hash and nothing else, and that is the hash every installer uses to verify what it downloaded. MD5 has been broken
against collision attacks for years; re-publishing it as a content hash would advertise a guarantee peryx will not stand
behind. SHA-256 supersedes it for that job, peryx computes SHA-256 for every file regardless of what the uploader
declared, and that is the digest it serves.

So MD5 lives entirely at the upload boundary. peryx accepts it because Warehouse does, verifies it when nothing stronger
was declared, and drops it the moment the file is stored.

## Equivalent version spellings

A release has more than one spelling. `1.0`, `1.0.0`, and `1.0.0.0` are one version under
[PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/), and every resolver, pip, uv, and pypi.org itself, treats them as one.
peryx serves them as one: a project page filtered to `1.0.0` shows a file whose form version was `1.0`. The
version-scoped admin operations, yank, delete, and promote, have to reach the same file, or they act on a release that
looks different from the one the page shows. They match by PEP 440 equality, and that is why.

### Two ways to compare a version

An upload records the version it was published with, whatever spelling the build tool wrote. A team that ships `1.0` and
a team that ships `1.0.0` have published the same release, and their files sit side by side on the project page. When an
operator addresses a release, they type one spelling: `yank 1.0.0`. Two things then have to decide whether a given file
belongs to that request, and they can disagree.

- The **served page** filters by PEP 440 equality. Ask for `1.0.0` and it returns every file of that release, `1.0` and
  `1.0.0.0` included, because that is what a release means to an installer.
- A **byte-exact** match compares the two strings. `1.0.0` does not equal `1.0`, so a file uploaded as `1.0` falls
  outside a request addressed to `1.0.0`.

While the served page used one rule and the mutations used the other, the operator saw one release and the operation
acted on another.

### The failure it prevents

peryx used to compare an upload's version to the requested version byte for byte inside yank, delete, and promote. A
release published as `1.0` was invisible to any request that spelled it another way:

- **Yank did nothing.** `PUT /root/pypi/mypkg/1.0.0/yank` on a file uploaded as `1.0` matched no file, reported zero
  files changed, and left the release live. The operator, reading `1.0.0` off the project page, had every reason to
  think the yank landed, and no sign that it had not.
- **Delete left the file up.** The same mismatch on a delete answered "nothing matched" while the file kept serving.
  Worse, delete falls back to matching on the stored record exactly when the served-page filter finds nothing, so the
  two version notions had to agree or the fallback missed too, in the one place it exists to catch the file.
- **Promote skipped the release.** A promote from a staging route to a release route stepped over a file whose spelling
  did not match, and shipped an incomplete release without saying so.

Each of these fails without a sign. The request succeeds, the count comes back zero, and the file stays as it was. An
operator learns the yank did not take only when a resolver installs the version they thought they had pulled.

### Why equality is the right rule

The operations route their version comparison through the same PEP 440 equality the served page uses, with a fall back
to byte comparison when a version does not parse. Addressing any spelling of a release now reaches every file of that
release, and the operation acts on the set of files the page shows for that version. The two sides of peryx, the page a
client reads and the mutation an operator runs, share one definition of what a release is.

### What stays strict for versions

Equality is one release, not a loose match. A request for `1.0` reaches `1.0.0` but never `1.0.1` or `1.1`; those are
different releases and stay untouched. The [local segment](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers)
counts: `1.0+build` and `1.0` are distinct versions and do not match. And a version that is not valid PEP 440 is
compared by its exact spelling, so a non-standard tag matches only itself. peryx reaches every spelling of the right
release; it does not reach the wrong one.

## Verb-named projects

peryx serves three mutations, yank and restore and promote, and names each one in the URL that performs it. A project
whose name is one of those words is a legal package, and peryx addresses it like any other. The name and the verb must
not share fate, or a delete becomes impossible.

### peryx does not reserve names

peryx is a private index and a mirror. It hosts whatever [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)-legal name you
push and whatever a cached upstream carries, and it keeps no list of prohibited or reserved project names. Blocking
names is a public-registry concern: pypi.org withholds some names to keep an open, shared namespace legible and to blunt
squatting. Inside your own index the namespace is yours, and `yank` is as valid a project as `requests`.

What the old router did have was an *accidental* reservation. The mutation URLs reuse the verbs as path segments, and
the routing peeled a trailing `yank`, `restore`, or `promote` off the path before it read the project name. When the
verb was the entire path, nothing was left to name the project, so the three verbs went missing as project-addressable
names, a side effect of the grammar rather than a rule anyone wrote.

### The failure it prevents

`DELETE /root/pypi/yank/` deletes the project `yank`. The old router read the trailing `yank` as the un-yank action,
looked for a project name in front of it, found none, and rejected the request with `400 Bad Request`. A project named
`yank` could be uploaded and installed but never deleted at the project level: its name shadowed the delete.

`yank` and `restore` are real projects on pypi.org, so the collision was reachable. It bit where peryx is meant to
disappear:

- **Mirroring.** A cached index pulls a project named `yank` from pypi.org into a virtual index, and the operator cannot
  later remove it from the hosted layer.
- **Migrating.** A team moving a back catalogue onto peryx re-uploads a package named `restore`, then finds it stuck: no
  project-level delete to undo a mistaken import.

An index that cannot delete a project it accepted is not a drop-in front for one that can.

### Where the line is now

peryx separates the two namespaces by position, not by forbidding the name. A trailing verb is an action only when a
project segment precedes it; a path that is nothing but the verb names the project. `DELETE /root/pypi/yank/` deletes
`yank`, `PUT /root/pypi/yank/yank` yanks it, and the versioned and normal project-level forms are unchanged. The
[reference](@/ecosystems/pypi/reference/uploads.md#mutation-paths-for-verb-named-projects) lists every path.

This does not loosen anything. A real yank still needs its `.../yank` suffix behind a project, a real delete still needs
the token and a volatile hosted layer. peryx stopped treating a lone verb as an action; it did not stop treating a
suffixed verb as one.
