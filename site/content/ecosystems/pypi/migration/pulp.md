[Pulp](https://pulpproject.org/) is a content-management platform whose
[pulp_python plugin](https://pulpproject.org/pulp_python/) is, feature for feature, velodex's closest living relative:
lazy (`on_demand`) mirroring of PyPI subsets, pull-through caching, uploads, curation with allow/deny lists, and
versioned repository snapshots. The difference is the machinery: a Pulp deployment is a Django REST API, a separate
content-serving app, one or more task workers, and PostgreSQL
([architecture](https://pulpproject.org/pulpcore/docs/admin/learn/architecture/)), and Pulp also manages RPMs,
containers, and other content types with the same model.

## Why velodex

If Python packages are the only content type you need, the platform is the overhead: four services and a database
against one binary and a data directory. velodex also serves at a plain index root instead of
`/pypi/{base_path}/simple/`, and its pull-through composes: virtual indexes can layer cached indexes of cached indexes,
where Pulp documents that
[chaining pull-through indices does not work](https://pulpproject.org/pulp_python/docs/user/guides/host/).

## The renames

| Pulp (pulp_python)                   | velodex                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| repository + remote + distribution   | one `[[index]]` entry                                                        |
| `policy = "on_demand"` remote        | the cached default                                                           |
| pull-through cache on a distribution | a cached layer in a virtual index                                            |
| includes/excludes curation           | shadowing plus [yank and hide overrides](@/ecosystems/pypi/guides/remove.md) |
| `…/pypi/{base_path}/simple/`         | `/{route}/simple/`                                                           |
| `pulp python content upload` / twine | twine / `uv publish`, unchanged                                              |
| repository version rollback          | not offered; deletes are the undo                                            |

## Pitfalls

- Pulp's versioned snapshots ("repoint the distribution at yesterday's repository version") have no velodex counterpart;
  if you rely on them for staged promotion, keep Pulp for that flow.
- Multi-tenancy via domains, RBAC, and the task queue are platform features velodex does not replicate.
- S3/Azure/GCS artifact storage is Pulp-native; velodex stores on local disk.
