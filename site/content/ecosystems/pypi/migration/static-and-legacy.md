A family of small solutions covers pieces of the job. Each is fine at its piece; the migrations below are for when the
pieces stop composing.

## dumb-pypi

[dumb-pypi](https://github.com/chriskuehl/dumb-pypi) generates a static [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/)
index from a list of filenames; the files live wherever a URL can reach ([S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[nginx](https://nginx.org/)), and having no server is the design. Publishing means regenerating the site; PyPI itself
still needs `--extra-index-url`; name normalization is your web server's problem. In peryx, uploads are the write path
(`twine upload`, index updated transactionally) and the same process mirrors PyPI, so clients keep one `index-url`.
Migration is a one-time [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/) loop over the bucket's files.

## Plain directories and `python -m http.server`

pip's [`--find-links`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/) accepts a directory listing, and `--index-url`
accepts any PEP 503-shaped tree, so a shared folder works with zero tooling. It also serves whole wheels to every
resolve (no [PEP 658](https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/) metadata), lists everything in one flat page, offers no
fallback to PyPI, and authenticates nobody. It remains the right tool for a laptop and a handful of wheels.

## pip2pi

[pip2pi](https://github.com/wolever/pip2pi) snapshots a requirements set into a static index; its last release and
commit are from August 2021. The workflow it automated (resolve on a connected side, carry the result) is the
[air-gap guide](@/ecosystems/pypi/guides/air-gapped.md) with a cache instead of a script: the carried data directory
keeps hashes, metadata, and the JSON API.

## nginx caching proxies

[nginx_pypi_cache](https://github.com/hauntsaninja/nginx_pypi_cache) is an nginx config that reverse-proxies pypi.org
and files.pythonhosted.org with `proxy_cache`: the read-through half of the job in one file, with the upstreams
hard-coded and no uploads or private packages. peryx adds the index-aware half: digest verification,
`Cache-Control`-driven refresh with a background sweep, private hosting, and [usage counters](@/core/monitor.md).
(Flask-Pypi-Proxy, sometimes cited alongside it, last released in 2014 and predates every modern index PEP.)

## The renames

| Setup                         | peryx                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| dumb-pypi regenerate + S3     | `twine upload` to a hosted index               |
| `--find-links /shared/wheels` | `--index-url http://host:4433/{route}/simple/` |
| `pip2pi` snapshot + rsync     | warm the cache, carry `data_dir`               |
| nginx `proxy_cache` config    | a cached index                                 |
