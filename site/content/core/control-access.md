Each task below is self-contained. They share one model, described in full under
[authentication and access control](@/core/authentication.md); this page is the cookbook.

Write and delete authorization runs through the model today, enforced as HTTP Basic auth on a PyPI upload and on a
`docker push`. The read side (`anonymous_read`) is recorded now and enforced when the read challenge ships, so you can
declare the policy ahead of the enforcement.

## Scope a token to some projects

Add an `[[index.access_token]]` table to the hosted index. `projects` is a list of globs; `actions` is any of `read`,
`write`, and `delete`.

```toml
[[index]]
name = "hosted"
hosted = true

[[index.access_token]]
name = "ci"
secret = "ci-secret"
projects = ["team-*", "shared/tools"]
actions = ["write"]
```

A client presents the secret as its Basic password (`-u __token__ -p ci-secret` for twine, `-p ci-secret` for
`docker login`). The token may write any project matching `team-*` or the exact name `shared/tools`, and nothing else. A
write to another name returns `403`. Give a token `actions = ["write", "delete"]` if the same credential should also
remove releases. An index can carry several `[[index.access_token]]` tables; each needs a distinct `name`.

## Let one token write everywhere

For a hosted index that a single trusted credential may write and delete across every project, the `upload_token` key is
the whole configuration:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "hosted"
upload_token = "hosted-secret"
```

This is sugar for one token granted write and delete over `*`. Use it when you do not need per-project scope; reach for
`[[index.access_token]]` the moment you do.

## Declare an index's reads private

By default any client may read an index. Set `anonymous_read = false` to require a credential to read it:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "internal"
hosted = true
anonymous_read = false

[[index.access_token]]
name = "reader"
secret = "reader-secret"
projects = ["*"]
actions = ["read"]
```

The flag records that this index's reads are not open, and a read-granting token expresses who may still read it. Read
enforcement arrives with the read challenge; until then the flag is recorded but reads are served openly, so treat this
as declaring the policy ahead of the gate.

## Close a whole server

Setting `anonymous_read = false` on every index is tedious and easy to forget on a new one. The `[auth]` table flips the
default instead:

```toml
[auth]
default_anonymous_read = false
```

Every index now defaults to private reads, and an index that should stay open opts back in with `anonymous_read = true`.
One knob makes a fully private server the default and a public index the exception.

## Keep a secret out of the config file

Every secret key has a `_file` sibling that names a path to read the value from, so the config file holds no plaintext:

```toml
[auth]
signing_key_file = "/run/secrets/peryx-signing-key"

[[index]]
name = "hosted"
upload_token_file = "/run/secrets/hosted-token"

[[index.access_token]]
name = "ci"
secret_file = "/run/secrets/ci-token"
projects = ["team-*"]
actions = ["write"]
```

peryx reads each file once at startup and trims trailing whitespace, so a file written by `echo` or mounted by an
orchestrator works unchanged. An empty file is a startup error. Set a key or its `_file` sibling, never both. This
composes with Docker and Kubernetes secret mounts under `/run/secrets`, systemd `LoadCredential`, and files rendered by
[Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault) or [SOPS](https://github.com/getsops/sops), covered in
[client auth versus upstream credentials](@/core/access-explained.md).
