Start with two concrete cases against a peryx that has never seen the artifact. A CI job runs `uv pip install pandas`:
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) asks for the pandas index page, then for a handful of `.metadata` files, then for the
wheels it chose. A developer runs `docker pull alpine`: [docker](https://www.docker.com/) asks for the `alpine`
manifest, then for the config and layer blobs it names. peryx has none of it. The naive proxy would download each thing,
store it, and then serve it, adding a full download of buffering delay on top of each upstream fetch. Most of this page
explains how peryx avoids that: the client receives bytes at upstream wire speed on a cold cache, and from local disk
and memory afterwards. The two ecosystems differ in wire protocol, not in this shape.

peryx is a single async [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) process built on [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and
[tokio](https://tokio.rs/). A request travels through three layers:

1. **Routing.** The HTTP layer validates configured index routes at startup, then resolves each request path by longest
   prefix. Routes are configuration data rather than compiled-in paths, and each request avoids decoding or normalizing
   route text. A route also carries its index's **ecosystem** (pypi and oci today), which selects the format driver (the
   wire protocol and artifact rules for that packaging format) at the routing boundary. Dispatch is a static match, not
   a runtime lookup, so an ecosystem a request does not use costs it nothing.
1. **Resolution.** The cache layer answers from local state when it can and talks to upstreams when it must. A virtual
   index walks its layers in order and merges their answers.
1. **Storage.** Two stores under one data directory hold all state.

## How a page is served

A simple-index page (say `/root/pypi/simple/pandas/`) can be answered three ways, tried in order of cost:

1. **Hot:** the transformed page sits in an in-memory cache, keyed by a mutation epoch so any upload or override
   invalidates it instantly. Serving is a lookup and a memcpy.
1. **Warm:** the raw upstream page sits in the metadata store and is still within its freshness window. peryx transforms
   it for the requesting route in one in-memory pass (file URLs rewritten, hosted uploads injected, yanked and hidden
   files applied) and remembers the result in the hot cache.
1. **Cold:** nothing usable is stored. peryx opens the upstream request and streams.

{% mermaid() %}

warm -->|yes| transform["transform in memory"] --> serve
warm -->|no| cold["stream from upstream"] --> serve2["serve while caching"]
class serve good
class cold,serve2 accent
{% end %}

The stored form is always the **raw upstream document** (HTML upstreams are canonicalized to
[PEP 691](https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/) JSON once, at fetch time). Transformation happens per request. That
ordering matters for virtual indexes: one cached [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) page can serve any number of routes that
layer it, each with different hosted files shadowing it, without storing a variant per route.

## How bytes reach the client before they reach the disk

The cold path is where proxies lose their users. peryx never buffers a whole response to work on it; both index
documents (a Simple page, an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) manifest) and artifacts (a wheel, a blob) stream, with
the caching work riding along. The PyPI shape, a page then the wheels it names:

{% mermaid() %}
sequenceDiagram
participant C as uv
participant V as peryx
participant U as upstream
C->>+V: GET simple/pandas/
V->>+U: GET (If-None-Match)
U-->>-V: 200, JSON streams
V-->>-C: transformed JSON, chunk by chunk
Note over V: raw page persists before the<br/>final chunk, so file lookups<br/>that follow always resolve
C->>+V: GET files/{sha256}/pandas…whl
V->>+U: GET wheel
U-->>-V: bytes
V-->>-C: the same bytes, teed to a temp file
Note over V: after the client has everything:<br/>verify sha256, rename into the store
{% end %}

The OCI shape, a manifest then the blobs it names:

{% mermaid() %}
sequenceDiagram
participant C as docker
participant V as peryx
participant U as upstream
C->>+V: GET /v2/…/manifests/alpine:latest
V->>+U: GET (bearer handshake)
U-->>-V: 200, manifest JSON
V-->>-C: manifest, byte-for-byte
Note over V: stored under the sha256 of its<br/>exact bytes, so the digest the<br/>client verifies matches
C->>+V: GET /v2/…/blobs/{sha256}
V->>+U: GET blob
U-->>-V: bytes
V-->>-C: the same bytes, teed to a temp file
Note over V: after the client has everything:<br/>verify sha256, rename into the store
{% end %}

For PyPI pages, a chunk-at-a-time transformer rewrites each `files[]` element mid-flight (URL rewriting, hosted-file
injection, yank and hide overrides), so the client starts parsing while the upstream transfer is still running. An OCI
manifest is served byte-for-byte instead, since its digest is the address a client checks; only its stored copy carries
the route. For artifacts (wheels, sdists, and OCI blobs alike), the tee hashes into a temp file that is verified and
atomically renamed into the store after the client already has its bytes. A digest mismatch still forwards
([pip](https://pip.pypa.io/), uv, and docker verify hashes themselves) but is never cached, and shows up as `rejected`
in the [usage counters](@/core/monitor.md).

File URLs put the sha256 in the path because it is the real storage key. The filename is kept for installer behavior,
browser save names, and operator logs, but peryx treats it as one percent-encoded path segment and rejects decoded
separators, traversal, and control characters. Archive inspection uses the same rule for the distribution filename and
passes member paths in a query parameter so member names can contain `/` without becoming route structure. The inspector
opens cached blobs from disk and returns member text by byte offset, so looking at a large generated file does not
require loading the whole archive member into server memory or the browser.

Nested ZIP inspection keeps the same constraint. Peryx reads stored ZIP members as seekable slices of the cached blob;
compressed nested archives stream into bounded temporary files because their inner directory cannot be addressed without
decompression. Listing and preview endpoints cap nesting depth, entry count, nested archive size, and returned text
bytes.

Three more decisions keep the cold path at wire speed:

- **Single-flight.** Resolvers fire many requests for the same project concurrently. Concurrent misses for one page or
  file share one upstream fetch; the rest wait for the first and serve from its result.
- **Nothing durable blocks the response.** Page records commit to redb without an fsync (losing a cache entry in a crash
  costs a refetch, nothing more), and artifact verification runs after the client's last byte.
- **HTTP/1.1 for artifact downloads.** HTTP/2 would multiplex every concurrent wheel over one TCP connection and its
  single congestion window; one connection per artifact keeps large parallel downloads at full bandwidth.

## When does cached content expire?

Artifacts never do. They are addressed by sha256, so "a new version of the file" is by definition a different file with
a different address; anything in the store is correct forever.

Pages do. Each cached page carries the freshness lifetime its upstream granted via `Cache-Control` (`s-maxage` over
`max-age`; pypi.org grants 600 seconds). When the server grants none (the header is absent, `no-cache`, `no-store`, or
zero), the configured `cache_ttl_secs` fallback of 300 seconds applies.

{% mermaid() %}
stateDiagram-v2
state "First fetch" as Initial
Initial --> Fresh
Fresh --> Stale: lifetime lapses
Stale --> Fresh: 304, nothing changed
Stale --> Fresh: 200, new content
Stale --> ServedStale: upstream down
ServedStale --> Fresh: upstream back
{% end %}

A stale page is not dropped: the next request revalidates it with `If-None-Match`, and the common answer is a `304` with
no body, which just resets the clock. A background sweep revalidates every stale page once a minute, so an upstream
change lands within about one freshness window even when nobody requests the page; each detected change is logged and
counted. When the upstream errors or is unreachable, the stale copy serves, and a pypi.org outage degrades to
stale-but-working rather than red builds.

## The metadata store

Project pages, file-to-URL mappings, uploads, and the change serial live in [redb](https://www.redb.org/), an embedded,
crash-safe, copy-on-write B-tree in pure Rust. redb gives one writer and many concurrent readers with snapshot
isolation, which fits an index server's read-heavy traffic without an external database. Page records use a framed
encoding (a small JSON header line, then the raw body bytes), so a multi-megabyte page is not re-encoded as JSON numbers
and header-only scans (the freshness sweep) skip the body.

The cache CLI uses the same store boundaries. Listing and size reporting walk redb tables row by row and summarize
framed page records without copying page bodies. Project purge deletes one page row, the project-display row, and only
the file URL or PEP 658 rows whose digests no other cached page or upload references. Peryx checks shared digest
references before deletion, so a purge for one project does not break another project that shares a file digest.

## The artifact store

Artifacts live in a content-addressed store keyed by sha256, fanned out two hex levels deep (`sha256/ab/cd/<digest>`).
Writes go to a temp file, fsync, then an atomic rename, so a crash cannot leave a partial blob visible; the path is the
digest, so anything present is by construction correct. One wheel uploaded to two indexes, or cached from two upstreams,
occupies disk once.

Cache validation streams each blob through sha256 and compares the result to the digest in the path. Orphaned-blob purge
first builds a set of digest references from metadata rows, then walks the blob tree one file at a time. It reads blob
contents only when `cache fsck` asks for hash validation.

Uploads use the same staged path as downloads: the multipart `content` field streams into a temp blob while sha256 and
blake2b-256 are computed. Validation reads the archive back from that staged file, so a large wheel is not buffered in
the HTTP handler. Wheel validation scans the ZIP directory, buffers capped `METADATA`, `WHEEL`, and `RECORD` files, and
streams members through the RECORD hash checks instead of loading wheel payloads into memory.

Sdist validation uses the same pattern. peryx streams the `.tar.gz` entries, rejects unsafe paths, unsafe links, and
special files, and buffers only capped `PKG-INFO` content. Metadata 2.4+ `License-File` entries are checked against the
member names seen during the scan; the archive is not unpacked.

## Why metadata-before-artifact matters here

Both ecosystems let a client learn what it needs from a small document before pulling large ones, and peryx leans on
that. PyPI has PEP 658; OCI has the manifest.

For PyPI: resolvers spend most of their network time learning dependencies. The
[PEP 658/714](https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/) `.metadata` sibling lets pip and uv fetch a few kilobytes of core
metadata instead of a multi-megabyte artifact per candidate. peryx uses an advertised upstream sibling first, verifies
it against the digest from the index page, and caches it like any blob. When the upstream page lacks that sibling, peryx
reads a wheel's ZIP central directory with HTTP byte ranges, fetches only the `METADATA` member, and records the
generated sibling for later page responses.

If an index does not satisfy range requests, peryx remembers that for the process and streams the artifact into the blob
store before extracting metadata from the cached file. Sdist backfill uses the same cached-file path and buffers only
capped `PKG-INFO` content. For hosted uploads, peryx writes the sibling from verified wheel `METADATA` or sdist
`PKG-INFO`. The per-index `peryx_index_metadata_total` metric counts these; the end-to-end tests assert on it to prove
real clients take this path. Few third-party indexes serve PEP 658 yet, so fronting one with peryx can make resolution
faster than the upstream itself once metadata is cached.

For OCI the analogue is built into the protocol: a client fetches the manifest (a small JSON document) before pulling
any config or layer blob, and often issues a `HEAD` to check a tag's digest without a body at all. peryx caches the
manifest like any other document, so once an image is warm a `docker pull` of an unchanged tag resolves from local disk
before a single layer moves.

## Usage metrics

Handlers record events (page served, file downloaded, upload accepted, refresh outcome) with one non-blocking channel
send; a dedicated thread aggregates them into an index → project → file tree. The request path never takes the
aggregation lock; recording costs one channel send. The tree serves [`/+stats`](@/core/monitor.md), the dashboard's
usage drill-down, and the per-index [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) counters.

## Distribution

peryx ships one static binary through two channels. GitHub releases carry per-platform archives and installer scripts
(built by [dist](https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/)); these copies carry the `self-update` feature and an install
receipt, so `peryx self update` can replace them in place. PyPI carries the same binary wrapped in a `bindings = "bin"`
wheel: Python-shop operators get peryx through the tooling they already run (`uv tool install`, a `requirements.txt`
line, an internal mirror) without a second artifact channel, and since no Python ABI is involved, one wheel per platform
serves every interpreter. Wheel installs have no self-update: pip owns that file, and the updater refuses copies without
a receipt rather than fight it.

## The web UI

The UI is a [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) application compiled twice from one codebase: natively into the server, which
renders every page to HTML, and to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (by
[cargo-leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos)), which hydrates the page in the browser for reactivity: live
counters, filter-as-you-type, and the upload-management buttons. Pages work without the bundle, so the server never
depends on a wasm toolchain.

This split also decides how the UI is tested. The server half is ordinary Rust: peryx's test suite renders each page
through the real router and asserts on the HTML. The browser half cannot feed the coverage gate, because
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no coverage instrumentation and event handlers only execute in a browser; a
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) suite drives the hydrated UI instead (search, package pages, the archive browser,
and token-authenticated yank and delete), which is the stronger check for interactive behavior anyway.

The UI reads peryx's own public API: `/+status` for the dashboard, `/+status?details=admin` for the admin status page,
`/+stats` for usage, the PEP 691 simple endpoints for package data, and the `inspect` endpoints for archive contents.
The admin status document summarizes metadata keys for observed project counts, uploaded file counts, and capped recent
uploads; it does not fetch upstreams or read cached artifact bytes. Anything the UI shows, a script can fetch the same
way.

## Tradeoffs

- **One process, local state.** No replication, no failover. A cache instance per site or cluster is the intended shape;
  each warms independently.
- **The first request for anything pays upstream latency.** Streaming removes the buffering penalty, not the network. A
  cold cache behaves like pypi.org plus one hop until it has seen your working set once.
- **redb has one writer.** Fine for an index server (reads dominate by orders of magnitude), wrong for a write-heavy
  workload.
- **Trust follows the hash.** peryx verifies artifacts against the digests the index page advertises. If an upstream
  lies about its own hashes, peryx caches the lie; it defends the transport, not the source.
