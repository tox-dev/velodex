In this tutorial you will add a named upload token to a hosted index, scope it to a set of projects with a glob, and
publish through it with twine. You will publish one package the token covers and watch a second one, outside the scope,
get turned away. It takes about ten minutes and builds on [getting started](@/core/getting-started.md).

The token is enforced through HTTP Basic auth: the same `__token__:<token>` convention pip and twine already use for
[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/), so no new client and no login step is involved. A hosted OCI index enforces the same
model on `docker push`; this walkthrough uses PyPI because twine needs the least setup.

## The goal

A hosted index that a CI job publishes to. The job's token may write projects named `team-*` and nothing else, so a
mistyped or malicious upload to another name fails at the door instead of landing in your store.

## Write the topology

Save this as `peryx.toml`:

```toml
data_dir = "peryx-data"

[[index]]
name = "pypi"
cached = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

[[index]]
name = "hosted"
hosted = true

[[index.access_token]]
name = "ci"
secret = "ci-secret"
projects = ["team-*"]
actions = ["write"]

[[index]]
name = "root/pypi"
layers = ["hosted", "pypi"]
upload = "hosted"
```

The `[[index.access_token]]` table names one credential the `hosted` index accepts. `secret` is the password a client
presents. `projects` is a list of globs, where `*` stands for any run of characters; `team-*` covers every project whose
normalized name starts with `team-`. `actions` lists what the token may do, from `read`, `write`, and `delete`.

Start peryx:

```shell
peryx serve --config peryx.toml
```

## Publish a project the token covers

Build a small package named `team-widgets` (reuse the steps from [getting started](@/core/getting-started.md), changing
the project name), then publish it to the virtual index's route. peryx accepts any username; the token is the password,
matching the `__token__` convention:

```shell
twine upload --repository-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p ci-secret dist/*
```

The upload succeeds. peryx matched the password against the `ci` token, saw the normalized project name `team-widgets`
against the token's `team-*` glob, and stored the file in the `hosted` layer.

## Watch a project outside the scope get refused

Now build a package named `other-widgets` and try the same command:

```shell
twine upload --repository-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p ci-secret dist/*
```

This one returns `403` with `token does not grant this action`. The credential is valid, so peryx does not ask you to
authenticate again; the token simply holds no grant for a project named `other-widgets`. Scope is enforced on the name
the upload declares, so a token cannot reach past the projects it was issued for.

## Observe the principal rate-limit bucket

Add a one-request listing limit to `peryx.toml`, then restart peryx:

```toml
[rate_limit]
enabled = true

[rate_limit.listing]
requests = 1
window_secs = 60
```

Send two listing requests with the `ci` password and different Basic usernames:

```shell
curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -u first:ci-secret http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/simple/
curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -u second:ci-secret http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/simple/
```

peryx returns `200` for the first request and `429` for the second. Both credentials resolve to the named principal
`ci`, so a Basic username change keeps the bucket. peryx groups a wrong password under the source address. A client
cannot gain fresh buckets by rotating invalid `Authorization` values.

Leave `trusted_proxies` unset for this local run. Named principals use their verified subject. The proxy list controls
the address bucket for anonymous or invalid credentials. For a proxy deployment, follow the
[reverse-proxy recipe](@/core/control-access.md#preserve-client-buckets-behind-a-reverse-proxy).

## The one-token shortcut

If you want a hosted index that a single trusted token may write and delete anywhere, you do not need an
`[[index.access_token]]` table at all. The older `upload_token` key still works and stands for exactly that, one
credential granted write and delete over every project:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "hosted"
upload_token = "hosted-secret"
```

An index configured this way behaves as it did before peryx had a token model. Reach for `[[index.access_token]]` when
one blanket credential is too much, which is the moment a scoped grant earns its keep.
