Every channel ships the same single static binary; pick by how you manage tools.

| Channel                    | Command                                                                                                    | Updates with              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Installer script (Unix)    | `curl -LsSf https://github.com/tox-dev/peryx/releases/latest/download/peryx-installer.sh \| sh`            | `peryx self update`       |
| Installer script (Windows) | `powershell -c "irm https://github.com/tox-dev/peryx/releases/latest/download/peryx-installer.ps1 \| iex"` | `peryx self update`       |
| PyPI wheel                 | `uv tool install peryx` or `pip install peryx`                                                             | `uv tool upgrade` / `pip` |
| From source                | `cargo build --release` in a checkout                                                                      | `git pull` and rebuild    |

## Platforms

GitHub releases carry binaries for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux glibc (x86_64 and aarch64), and Windows x64,
each with a sha256 checksum. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
[wheels](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/) additionally cover musl
Linux ([Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/)) on both architectures and Windows arm64; the wheel embeds the same binary as
a console script, so no Python ABI is involved and one wheel per platform serves every interpreter.

## Self-update

`peryx self update` replaces the binary with the newest GitHub release. It works only for copies placed by the installer
scripts: those write an install receipt the updater reads. A pip- or cargo-installed peryx has no receipt and is refused
with a pointer back to its own package manager, so two tools never fight over one file.
