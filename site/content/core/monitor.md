velodex counts everything it serves, off the request path. Four surfaces show the same numbers: the dashboard, the admin
status page, the `/+stats` JSON endpoint, and Prometheus `/metrics`.

## Drill down from the dashboard

Each index card on the dashboard shows its pages, downloads, and bytes served, with a `usage` link. The link opens the
drill-down: totals for the index and a table of its projects, each project linking to its per-file counters. The same
pages live at `/stats`, `/stats?index={route}`, and `/stats?index={route}&project={name}`.

{{ screen(alt="The usage drill-down for one index: totals up top, busiest projects first", name="stats-index") }}

{{ screen(alt="One project drilled to file level: downloads, bytes, and metadata hits per artifact", name="stats-project") }}

## Query the counters

```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4433/+stats | jq
curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/+stats?index=root/pypi' | jq '.projects | to_entries | sort_by(-.value.downloads)[:5]'
curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/+stats?index=root/pypi&project=numpy' | jq .files
```

Counters live in memory and reset on restart; for durable time series, scrape `/metrics`, which exposes the same set per
index alongside the global request counter. The `ecosystem` label carries each index's format, so a query can split PyPI
from OCI traffic:

```text
velodex_index_downloads_total{index="root/pypi",ecosystem="pypi",role="virtual"}
velodex_index_downloads_total{index="root/oci",ecosystem="oci",role="virtual"}
```

## Check operational status

`/admin/status` combines `GET /+status?details=admin` with top-level `GET /+stats`. It shows the configured index
topology next to the same cache-health counters listed below, plus observed project counts, upload counts, recent
uploads, cached index URLs, and redacted token/authentication state. The page does not fetch upstreams or read artifacts
while it renders.

## What the cache-health counters mean

| Counter           | Signal                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refreshes`       | Revalidations against upstream, on demand or from the background sweep      |
| `changed`         | Revalidations that found new upstream content; also logged at `info`        |
| `stale_served`    | Pages served from cache because upstream was down; rising means an outage   |
| `upstream_errors` | Upstream failures with nothing cached to fall back to; clients saw an error |
| `rejected`        | Downloads whose bytes did not match the advertised digest; never cached     |

A steady `refreshes` with zero `changed` is the normal idle state. `rejected` above zero deserves attention: either the
upstream served corrupt bytes or something rewrote them in transit.

## Inspect the disk cache

Use the cache CLI when you need the state on disk, not request counters. It works the same for either ecosystem: the
blob store is content-addressed and shared, and `--index` selects a PyPI or an OCI index by route.

```shell
velodex cache size --data-dir /var/lib/velodex
velodex cache list --data-dir /var/lib/velodex --stale
velodex cache list --data-dir /var/lib/velodex --index dockerhub
velodex cache fsck --data-dir /var/lib/velodex
```

`cache size` reports cached pages, stale pages, blob files, bytes, and metadata row counts. `cache list --stale` lists
the stale pages with age and freshness lifetime. `cache fsck` validates metadata row shapes and stream-hashes blob files
against their sha256 path.

Use two steps for project purge. First print the plan, then rerun with `--yes` if the row counts match what you expect.

```shell
velodex cache purge project --data-dir /var/lib/velodex --index pypi --project flask
velodex cache purge project --data-dir /var/lib/velodex --index pypi --project flask --yes
velodex cache purge orphaned-blobs --data-dir /var/lib/velodex
velodex cache purge orphaned-blobs --data-dir /var/lib/velodex --yes
```

Project purge removes metadata rows and leaves blobs in place. Orphaned-blob purge removes blob files that no metadata
row references.
