A full PyPI mirror is double-digit terabytes, almost all of which nobody on your network will ever install. A
read-through cache is the practical alternative: a partial mirror containing exactly the packages your users have
asked for. Two topologies cover the common cases.

## Controlled egress: velodex as the choke point

The network allows outbound traffic only from approved hosts. Run velodex on one of them; everything else installs
through it and needs no internet route:

```toml
# velodex.toml on the egress host
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 4433
data_dir = "/var/lib/velodex"
```

Clients set `PIP_INDEX_URL`/`UV_INDEX_URL` to `http://<egress-host>:4433/root/pypi/simple/` and are done. You get
one place to firewall, one place to [watch](@/guides/monitor.md) (every download is counted per project and file),
and one place where [private packages shadow upstream](@/explanation/indexes.md).

If the egress host itself must go through a corporate proxy, standard `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables apply to
velodex's upstream client.

## True air gap: warm, carry, serve

With no route at all, populate the cache on a connected network and move the data directory across the gap:

```shell
# connected side: install the working set through a scratch velodex
velodex serve --data-dir ./velodex-data &
export UV_INDEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/simple/
uv pip install --dry-run -r requirements.txt   # resolve pulls pages and metadata
uv pip install -r requirements.txt             # download pulls the wheels
```

Everything the installs touched — pages, PEP 658 metadata, wheels — now sits under `./velodex-data`. Copy that
directory to the isolated network (it is plain files; `tar` and `rsync` both work) and serve it there:

```shell
velodex serve --data-dir ./velodex-data
```

Artifacts serve straight from the store. Cached pages past their freshness window serve stale when the upstream is
unreachable, which on an air-gapped network is always — so the index keeps answering with exactly what was carried
over. Repeat the warm-and-carry cycle whenever the requirement set changes.

Resolve against a lock file (`uv.lock`, `requirements.txt` with hashes) on the connected side, so the isolated side
asks only for things the carry-over contains.

## What to check

- `curl http://<host>:4433/+status` — the index list and counters.
- `curl 'http://<host>:4433/+stats?index=root/pypi'` — what is being served from the cache.
- The `stale_served` counter climbing on the gapped side is normal; `upstream_errors` above zero means a client
  asked for something the cache has never seen.
