velodex serves a reactive web interface on its own port: server-rendered pages that hydrate in the browser, in the same
visual style as this site.

## Dashboard

`http://<host>:<port>/` shows the version, the change serial, live request counters (including PEP 658 metadata hits),
and a card per configured index with its kind, route, layers, whether it accepts uploads, and its usage: pages served,
downloads, and bytes. The counters refresh every few seconds.

{{ screen(alt="The dashboard: counters on top, one card per index with its layer stack and usage", name="dashboard") }}

Each card's `usage` link opens the drill-down described in [monitoring](@/guides/monitor.md): index totals, a
per-project table, and per-file download counts.

## Admin status

`/admin/status` reads `GET /+status?details=admin` and top-level `GET /+stats`. It shows configured repositories,
routes, overlay member order, upload targets by name, observed project counts, uploaded file counts, recent uploads,
mirror URLs, redacted authentication state, and cache-health counters. It also links to the JSON status, JSON stats,
Prometheus metrics, Simple API, browse, and usage pages.

The admin status document scans metadata keys once to count observed projects and uploaded files, then keeps only a
capped recent-upload list per index. It does not fetch upstreams, read package detail pages, read artifacts, or expose
upload tokens, upstream passwords, bearer tokens, URL user info, URL queries, or URL fragments.

## Browsing packages

The header search box starts suggesting packages after two characters. Suggestions and the full `/search` page use the
same `GET /+search` API, so hosted uploads, cached upstream pages, and overlay overrides rank from one indexed view.
Repository policy filters search results before they reach the UI.

`/search` keeps `q`, `type`, `page`, and `page_size` in the URL. The `type` filter accepts hosted, upstream, and
upstream-overrides packages; the UI labels the last one as `Upstream+`. Page size choices are 25, 50, and 100, and the
browser stores the last selected size for the next search.

An index card links to its project list, filterable as you type. A project page shows what pypi.org would: the rendered
long description, summary, install command with a copy button, versions, dependencies, keywords, license, author,
project links, grouped classifiers, and a file table with sizes, upload dates, sha256 digests, and yank/metadata badges.

{{ screen(alt="A project page: description and files on the left, metadata panel on the right", name="project") }}

Inspectable wheels, zips, zipped eggs, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz` archives get a `contents` link. It opens the
archive browser: members with their sizes, and member text in bounded chunks for large generated files. Other legacy
compressed tar formats such as `.tar.bz2`, `.tbz`, `.tar.xz`, `.txz`, `.tlz`, `.tar.lz`, `.tar.lzma`, and `.tar.zst`
still show as downloadable files, but do not get a broken archive link. The browser URL stores the file's sha256,
display filename, selected member, and chunk offset as separate query parameters. That keeps links stable for filenames
and member paths containing spaces, slashes, `#`, or `?`.

Browse pages keep empty results separate from request failures. A failed project lookup, metadata fetch, archive list,
or member preview shows the HTTP status and response body from velodex, including the index, project, digest, or file
context the server can provide.

## Managing uploads

"Manage uploads" on a project page takes the index's upload token and offers yank, un-yank, and delete per version, plus
whole-project delete. The buttons drive the same HTTP endpoints as [curl would](@/guides/remove.md), so the rules match:
deleting uploads needs a `volatile` index, and files served from a mirror are hidden reversibly rather than deleted.

## Requirements

The interactive layer is a wasm bundle built by [cargo-leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos)
(`cargo leptos build --release`, output in `ui/pkg/`, served at `/pkg`). Without the bundle every page still renders
server-side; typeahead, filtering, live counters, stored page-size choices, and the admin buttons need it.
