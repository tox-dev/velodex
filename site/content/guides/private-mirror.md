Declare a mirror index whose `mirror` field is the upstream's simple-index URL. Two authentication styles cover the
common servers; a bearer token wins when you set both.

## Artifactory or GitLab (bearer token)

```toml
[[index]]
name = "corp"
mirror = "https://myco.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi/simple/"
token = "<access-token>"
```

## pypi.org-style Basic auth

pypi.org tokens use the `__token__` username convention from the
[`.pypirc` specification](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/):

```toml
[[index]]
name = "corp"
mirror = "https://private.example/simple/"
username = "__token__"
password = "<token>"
```

Start velodex with `--config` and install through `http://<host>:<port>/corp/simple/`.

## Sync for offline use

Mirror sync uses the same upstream URL and credentials as serving. Configure the working set next to the mirror, then
populate and verify the cache while the upstream is reachable:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "corp"
mirror = "https://private.example/simple/"
token = "<token>"

[index.prefetch]
requirements = ["requirements.txt"]
```

```shell
velodex mirror sync corp --config velodex.toml
velodex mirror verify corp --config velodex.toml
velodex serve --config velodex.toml --offline
```

Set `offline = true` on the mirror when only that upstream should stay cache-only. Use the top-level `offline = true` or
`serve --offline` when every mirror in the process must avoid network access.

## HTML upstreams

Some mirrors, including Artifactory, serve the PEP 503 HTML form instead of PEP 691 JSON. velodex requests
[PEP 691](https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/) JSON first, parses HTML when the upstream returns it, and serves JSON to
pip and uv. You do not configure this; it happens per response. The upstream response must send a Simple API content
type (`text/html`, `application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+html`, or `application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json`); other content types
return `502` with the upstream URL in the error body.

## Notes

- The config file holds these credentials, so restrict it: `chmod 600 velodex.toml`.
- Each mirror keeps its own credentials. A cached file remembers which mirror it came from, and a later cache-miss fetch
  reuses that mirror's authentication.
- Velodex asks upstream for `Accept-Encoding: identity` during artifact downloads. This makes the bytes pip and uv
  verify match the cached bytes. Same-host redirects keep the mirror's credentials.
- `cache_ttl_secs` (default 1800) controls how long velodex serves a cached project page before revalidating it against
  the upstream with `If-None-Match`.
- Velodex caches upstream `404` misses for project pages and `.metadata` siblings for 30 seconds.
