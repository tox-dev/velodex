velox accepts the [legacy upload API](https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/), the wire protocol both [twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/) and
[`uv publish`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/) speak. Uploads need a local index with an `upload_token`; the default topology's `local` index has none,
so uploads are off until you set one:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "pypi"
mirror = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

[[index]]
name = "local"
upload_token = "<secret>"

[[index]]
name = "root/pypi"
layers = ["local", "pypi"]
upload = "local"
```

Then publish to the overlay's route. velox accepts any username; the token is the password, matching the pypi.org
`__token__` convention:

```shell
twine upload --repository-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p <secret> dist/*
# or
uv publish --publish-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p <secret> dist/*
```

velox verifies the declared sha256 digest against the received bytes, stores the file content-addressed, and serves
it from `/root/pypi/simple/<project>/` alongside the mirror's packages. Your file shadows an upstream file of the
same name.

## In `.pypirc`

The [`.pypirc` file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/) holds the repository and credentials:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers = velox

[velox]
repository = http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/
username = __token__
password = <secret>
```

`twine upload -r velox dist/*` then works without flags.
