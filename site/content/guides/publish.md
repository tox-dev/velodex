velodex accepts the [legacy upload API](https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/), the wire protocol both
[twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/) and [`uv publish`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/) speak. Uploads need
a local index with an `upload_token`; the default topology's `local` index has none, so uploads are off until you set
one:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "pypi"
mirror = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

[[index]]
name = "local"
upload_token = "<secret>"

[[index]]
name = "root/pypi"
layers = ["local", "pypi"]
upload = "local"
```

Then publish to the overlay's route. velodex accepts any username; the token is the password, matching the pypi.org
`__token__` convention:

```shell
twine upload --repository-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p <secret> dist/*
# or
uv publish --publish-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/ -u __token__ -p <secret> dist/*
```

velodex accepts wheels and modern `.tar.gz` source distributions. It rejects `.egg`, `.zip`, and ambiguous legacy
archives on upload; those files can still be mirrored if an upstream index lists them. During upload, velodex checks the
declared sha256 and blake2b-256 digests while streaming the artifact into a staged blob. A lone md5 digest is rejected.

Before publishing the staged blob, velodex validates the project name, PEP 440 version, safe filename shape, `filetype`,
archive readability, and metadata identity. Wheel uploads must contain one normalized `{name}-{version}.dist-info/`
directory with `METADATA`, `WHEEL`, and `RECORD`. The `WHEEL` tags and optional build field must match the filename, and
`RECORD` must cover each archive file except `RECORD` and deprecated RECORD signatures with sha256-or-better hashes.
When `RECORD` includes a size, the size must match the archive member.

Modern sdists must be `.tar.gz` files whose filename follows PEP 625. The archive must contain one top-level
`{name}-{version}/` directory with `pyproject.toml` and `PKG-INFO`. velodex rejects tar entries with absolute paths,
traversal, unsafe links, special files, or device entries. For Metadata 2.4 and newer, every `License-File` header must
name a file inside the sdist.

The filename, form fields, and `METADATA` or `PKG-INFO` `Name` and `Version` must agree. `Metadata-Version`,
`Requires-Python`, license fields, extras, and project URLs are compared when the upload form supplies them and the
metadata model can represent them. `Requires-Python`, when present in the form or metadata, must parse as Python version
specifiers.

Accepted files are stored content-addressed and served from `/root/pypi/simple/<project>/` alongside the mirror's
packages. Your file shadows an upstream file of the same name. For wheels, velodex extracts `METADATA`; for sdists, it
extracts the verified `PKG-INFO`. Both are served as PEP 658/714 `.metadata` siblings, so resolvers get the fast path
for your uploads and the web UI can show the full package page.

## In `.pypirc`

The [`.pypirc` file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/) holds the repository and
credentials:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers = velodex

[velodex]
repository = http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/
username = __token__
password = <secret>
```

`twine upload -r velodex dist/*` then works without flags.

`GET /root/pypi/+api` returns the same `.pypirc` shape when the request reaches Velodex with the public `Host` header.
The discovery document keeps the password as `<upload-token>`; replace it with the local index token before publishing.
For offline setup, print the same snippet from the config file:

```shell
velodex config-snippet --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4433 --index root/pypi .pypirc
```

## Upload failures

Validation failures return `400` with the field or archive check that failed. Common causes:

- The filename is not a wheel or `.tar.gz` sdist.
- The filename's normalized project name or version does not match the form fields.
- The archive is corrupt, lacks required wheel or sdist files, has unsafe tar entries, or has a bad `RECORD`.
- Core metadata names a different project or version.
- A Metadata 2.4+ sdist lists a `License-File` that is missing from the archive.
- A declared sha256 or blake2b-256 digest does not match the received bytes.
- The same filename was already uploaded with different bytes.
