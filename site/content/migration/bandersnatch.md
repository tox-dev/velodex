[bandersnatch](https://github.com/pypa/bandersnatch) is PyPI's official full-mirror client: a serial-based delta sync of
the whole index (or a filtered subset) onto your filesystem, served by a web server you bring. All of PyPI is currently
[41.8 TB](https://pypi.org/stats/), and the mirror can lag the index by
[up to about an hour](https://bandersnatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It remains the right tool when policy demands
every package offline with no warm-up phase.

## Why velodex

Most mirrors exist to serve a working set thousands of times smaller than PyPI. A read-through cache stores exactly that
set, populated on first use at [no install-time penalty](@/explanation/performance.md), serves it itself (no nginx
layer, no name-normalization rewrite rules), stays as fresh as upstream's `Cache-Control`, and hosts your private
packages besides. bandersnatch's filter plugins narrow the terabytes; a cache removes the guessing.

## The renames

| bandersnatch                                  | velodex                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `bandersnatch mirror` on a timer              | nothing: the cache populates on request            |
| `/etc/bandersnatch.conf` `[mirror] directory` | `data_dir`                                         |
| `allowlist_project` / requirements filters    | `[index.policy]` project rules, or the working set |
| platform and Python wheel filters             | `[index.policy]` wheel tag rules                   |
| nginx serving `web/`                          | built-in server                                    |
| `--force-check` full re-sync                  | delete `data_dir` (worst case: a refetch)          |

## Pitfalls

- A cache has a warm-up: nothing is present until first requested. For an air gap, warm it on a connected network and
  [carry the data directory across](@/guides/air-gapped.md).
- "Every package, guaranteed present" is bandersnatch's contract, not velodex's; if an auditor requires the full index
  offline, stay with the mirror.
- bandersnatch can prebuild a filtered filesystem mirror. velodex applies policy when it serves, mirrors, caches, or
  accepts an upload; a cold cache still warms on first allowed request.
