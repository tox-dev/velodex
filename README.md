# <img src="assets/icon.svg" width="28" alt=""> velodex

A PyPI-compatible read-through cache and private index, written in Rust. Point pip, uv, or twine at velodex: it proxies
and caches pypi.org (or any private mirror), hosts your own uploads in overlays on top, and serves both through the wire
protocols the clients already speak.

```shell
cargo build --release
./target/release/velodex serve
uv pip install --index-url http://127.0.0.1:4433/root/pypi/simple/ requests
```
