//! Streaming transformation of upstream PEP 691 pages.
//!
//! The transformer consumes raw upstream JSON chunk by chunk (mid-token boundaries included) and
//! emits the page peryx serves, without ever holding more than one `files[]` element: file URLs are
//! rewritten to the serving route, locally uploaded files are injected ahead of the upstream ones,
//! shadowed and hidden files are dropped, yank overrides are applied, and version lists merge. The
//! client starts receiving bytes while the upstream download is still in flight, so a cold page
//! costs wire time, not wire time plus parse-transform-serialize.
