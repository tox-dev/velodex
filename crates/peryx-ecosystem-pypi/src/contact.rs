//! Contact addresses, the value grammar of the `Author-email` and `Maintainer-email` core-metadata
//! fields.
//!
//! Core Metadata gives each field the legal forms of an RFC 822 `From` header: a comma-separated
//! list of addresses, each either bare or a display name with the address in angle brackets. Peryx
//! splits the list and lifts the address out of a named entry with the RFC 822 mechanics
//! `parse_metadata` already hand-rolls, then defers the address grammar to the `email_address` crate
//! the way it defers license and version grammars to focused crates, rather than re-derive an
//! addr-spec here.
