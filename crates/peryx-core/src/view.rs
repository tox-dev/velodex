//! Neutral view models the web UI renders.
//!
//! The UI is ecosystem-agnostic: it lays out a page but knows nothing about wheels, core metadata or
//! `PyPI` headers. Each ecosystem crate turns its own format into these neutral shapes, and the web
//! crate renders them. The models are pure serde with no rendering or I/O, so they cross the
//! server/browser boundary and pull no UI toolkit into an ecosystem crate.
//!
//! The metadata panel is a list of [`UiBlock`]s — a small vocabulary of presentation primitives keyed
//! by *shape* (a key/value, a chip set, a link list), never by ecosystem. An ecosystem composes those
//! primitives to describe its own format, so a new ecosystem adds no field here and no branch in the
//! web crate. [`UiBlock`] is `#[non_exhaustive]`: a genuinely new primitive is one additive variant
//! plus one match arm in the renderer, and the renderer's catch-all keeps an unknown block from
//! silently rendering nothing. This is the server-driven-UI shape Airbnb's section union and Sanity's
//! Portable Text use, sized down to what a package page needs.
