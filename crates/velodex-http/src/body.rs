/// A blocking reader fills a small channel of owned buffers while hyper drains it, so the read and the
/// write overlap instead of alternating: a pull-driven `ReaderStream` awaits each read to complete
/// before writing that chunk, serializing two independent I/O waits. `offset`/`length` select the byte
/// range to serve (`0` and the file length for a whole file); the reader also stops at EOF, so a
/// `length` past the end is harmless. A read error poisons the stream so hyper aborts the response
/// rather than serving a silently truncated body.
