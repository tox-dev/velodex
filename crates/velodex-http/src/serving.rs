//! The ecosystem serving interface.
//!
//! The router is ecosystem-neutral: it resolves a request to a configured index and hands the request
//! to that index's ecosystem driver. Each ecosystem implements [`EcosystemServing`] to serve its own
//! wire protocol (`PyPI`'s Simple API today; an `OCI` `/v2/` or npm registry later). The driver is held on
//! [`AppState`] and dispatched dynamically once per request, so adding an ecosystem is a new driver,
//! not a change to the router.
