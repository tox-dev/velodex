//! The legacy `PyPI` multipart upload API, used unchanged by both twine and `uv publish`.
//!
//! The wire logic here is pure: authentication is a header check, and turning a parsed multipart
//! form into a stored file is validation plus content addressing. The async multipart reading lives
//! in the handler; everything it depends on is unit-testable without a server.
