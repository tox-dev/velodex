//! Identity and access for velodex.
//!
//! Today this is a single credential check: a hosted index accepts an upload when the request carries
//! the index's upload token as its HTTP Basic-auth password (the `__token__` convention pip and twine
//! use). The logic is pure — a header string in, a decision out — so it needs no HTTP or storage
//! dependency and is trivial to test.
//!
//! It is the seam the richer access model grows behind: named and scoped tokens with expiry, read
//! ACLs, macaroon-style attenuable credentials, and OIDC trusted-publishing token minting. Those land
//! as an `IdentityProvider`/verifier trait here (the serving layer already routes every upload through
//! this crate), so adding them does not touch the request handlers.
