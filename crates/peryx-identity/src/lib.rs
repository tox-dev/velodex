//! Identity and access for peryx.
//!
//! A request arrives with a credential, or with none; an index declares who may do what. This crate
//! holds both halves and the one decision between them: [`IndexAcl::identify`] turns a credential into
//! a [`Principal`], and [`authorize`] says whether that principal may take an [`Action`] on a project
//! in an index. Every ecosystem calls the same entry point, so the access rules live in one place
//! instead of once per wire protocol.
//!
//! The model is neutral by construction. It knows a principal, an index ACL, a project name and an
//! action, and nothing about how a client presented itself: an OCI scope string, a `PyPI` Basic header
//! and a bearer token all reduce to those four before they reach [`authorize`]. A grant carries project
//! globs (`team/*`), which match `PyPI` project names and OCI repository names alike.
//!
//! [`Signer`] mints and verifies the audience-bound JWTs a token realm hands out. It lives here because
//! the signing key is identity state, not protocol state: an ecosystem's token endpoint calls `mint`
//! with the grants [`authorize`] approved and never sees the key.
//!
//! [`authorize_publish`] is the other way grants are approved: a CI job presents an OIDC identity token
//! instead of a secret, and a configured [`TrustedPublisher`] turns its verified claims into the same
//! grants `mint` signs — trusted publishing without a long-lived credential to rotate.
