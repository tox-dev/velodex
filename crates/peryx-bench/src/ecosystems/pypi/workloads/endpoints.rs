//! The endpoints workload: what one warm request to each endpoint peryx serves costs.
//!
//! The other workloads drive a real client and measure what a user feels, so they only ever touch the
//! three endpoints an installer touches. That leaves most of the surface unmeasured, and an
//! unmeasured endpoint is where a regression hides: the simple index root, the two PEP 503 HTML
//! representations, the legacy JSON API, the PEP 658 sibling, and peryx's archive introspection.
//!
//! Each row is one endpoint, timed warm: the server has already answered it once, so the row prices
//! serving rather than filling a cache.
//!
//! This one table is peryx against itself, not against the field. Unlike OCI, whose `/v2/` paths the
//! distribution spec fixes, a `PyPI` server is free to shape its own urls and to decide what its index
//! root even contains: pypi.org answers `/pypi/{project}/json` where peryx answers
//! `{index}/{project}/json`, devpi addresses files by an internal path, and a proxy's index root lists
//! what it has cached while pypi.org's lists every project that exists. Rows across those servers
//! would compare different work and read as a ranking. The cross-server comparisons live in the
//! workloads above, which drive one client against all of them.
