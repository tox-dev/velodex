//! The four workloads: installs, file throughput, a parallel CI fleet, and a request swarm.
//!
//! Every workload measures each server over `rounds` independent restarts: a fresh process and empty
//! state per round, so a cold pass is genuinely cold each time and the round-to-round spread captures
//! the between-launch variance (page cache, allocator layout, CPU frequency) that repeating inside one
//! process cannot see. The per-round samples reduce to a median with its dispersion (see
//! [`crate::report`] and [`crate::stats`]); the old best-of-N minimum is gone because its bias grows
//! with the round count and would make two runs of different lengths incomparable. Cold passes hit the
//! real upstream and are marked network-bound so a regression check skips their CDN-driven variance.
