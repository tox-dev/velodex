//! The seam an ecosystem plugs into.
//!
//! An ecosystem crate implements one [`EcosystemDriver`](serving::EcosystemDriver) and nothing else;
//! where it mounts (per-index, or an absolute prefix like `OCI`'s `/v2/`) is data on the driver, not a
//! second trait. Everything a driver needs to do that lives here: the process
//! [`AppState`], the per-index route resolution it serves through, blob-download coordination, request
//! classification for rate limiting, and the discovery envelope.
//!
//! The router that dispatches to a driver sits *above* this crate, in `peryx-http`. An ecosystem
//! therefore never depends on the serving layer that hosts it, only on the seam it fills.
