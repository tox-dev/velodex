//! Typed node-local jobs: a registry-free scheduler for a single node's maintenance work.
//!
//! A [`NodeJob`] declares its low-cardinality [`kind`](NodeJob::kind), the repository
//! [`scope`](NodeJob::scope) it acts on (its conflict key within a kind), and whether it records a
//! durable run through [`persist_as`](NodeJob::persist_as). The [`JobScheduler`] runs jobs on the
//! Tokio runtime under global, per-kind, and per-repository bounds, hands each a [`JobContext`] that
//! carries the serving state and a cancellation signal, and refuses overlapping or excess work rather
//! than queueing it unbounded.
//!
//! The background maintenance the server runs on a timer — reclaim idle process resources, then
//! revalidate stale cached pages — is expressed as one [`MaintenanceJob`] per installed ecosystem
//! driver, so independent ecosystems sweep concurrently while a single ecosystem never sweeps itself
//! twice at once.
