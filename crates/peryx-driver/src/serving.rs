//! The ecosystem serving interface.

//! The router is ecosystem-neutral: it resolves a request to a configured index and hands it to that
//! index's [`EcosystemDriver`]. Each ecosystem implements one driver; where it mounts is data, not a
//! second trait. A driver held in the registry on [`AppState`] is dispatched once per request, so
//! adding an ecosystem is a new driver rather than a change to the router.
