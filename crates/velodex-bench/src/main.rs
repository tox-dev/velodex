//! Benchmark velodex against direct `PyPI` and competing index servers.
//!
//! Five workloads, each a table in the site's TOML report:
//!
//! - **install**: time `uv pip install` and `pip install` of the top `PyPI` packages through each server, cold (fresh
//!   server state) and warm (the server keeps its cache, the client starts over). This is the number a user feels.
//! - **throughput**: move one large wheel; four clients racing for it cold, then single and eight-way parallel
//!   downloads of it hot.
//! - **parallel installs**: ten venvs install polars at once with separate client caches, like ten CI jobs hitting the
//!   same server, cold and warm.
//! - **metadata**: fetch a batch of PEP 658 metadata siblings cold, then hot, pricing the resolver fast path without
//!   downloading the whole artifact.
//! - **load**: request-level throughput, one user and a concurrent swarm, against each warm server.
//!
//! Every table also reports what the server itself burned while its workload ran: CPU seconds and
//! peak resident memory across the whole process tree. Results land in
//! `site/data/bench/report.toml`; the documentation renders them as tinted tables (best-in-row
//! green to worst-in-row red) via the `bench` shortcode. One command reproduces every table
//! (velodex is built automatically when the release binary is missing):
//!
//! ```shell
//! cargo run --release -p velodex-bench
//! ```
